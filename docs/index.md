## Introduction

This application generates input files for Quantum Espresso single point energy calculations for 3D inorganic materials with optimized kmeshes.

### What Goldilocks Does

Performing a simple SCF energy calculation requires choosing several parameters:
- **Functional**: Exchange-correlation functional (PBE or PBEsol)
- **Pseudopotentials**: From the SSSP library, with efficiency or precision modes
- **Cutoffs**: Plane wave cutoff values for energy and density
- **K-mesh**: K-point sampling grid
- **Smearing**: Smearing method and corresponding degauss value
- **Magnetic configuration**: For magnetic compounds, appropriate spin configuration and starting magnetizations

These parameters can usually be chosen in multiple ways. Choosing a set that provides a given calculation accuracy typically requires additional calculations to check convergence. Goldilocks predicts good parameter sets using machine learning models, helping you avoid running convergence studies or providing a good starting point for such calculations.

### Key Features

- **ML-based k-point prediction**: Uses Random Forest or ALIGNN models trained on large dataset of convergence values to predict optimal k-point spacing with confidence intervals
- **Automatic parameter selection**: Chooses pseudopotentials and cutoffs based on SSSP recommendations
- **Multiple generation methods**: Deterministic (ASE-based) or LLM-assisted generation
- **Database integration**: Search for structures in free materials databases (JARVIS, Materials Project, MC3D, OQMD)
